state EnterState {
  EnterState : Entry point for leaf state
}

EnterState --> ExecuteEnterOperation : Step 1: Enter the state

state ExecuteEnterOperation {
  ExecuteEnterOperation : Execute current state's enter operation
}

ExecuteEnterOperation --> ExecuteDuringOperation : Step 2: Execute enter operation

state ExecuteDuringOperation {
  ExecuteDuringOperation : Execute current state's during operation
}

ExecuteDuringOperation --> CheckTransitions : Step 3: Execute during operation

state CheckTransitions {
  CheckTransitions : Check transition events and guards
}

CheckTransitions --> ExecuteDuringOperation : Step 4a: No transition triggered\n(back to step 3)
CheckTransitions --> ExecuteExitOperation : Step 4b: Transition triggered

state ExecuteExitOperation {
  ExecuteExitOperation : Execute current state's exit operation
}
