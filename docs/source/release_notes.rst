Release Notes
=============

DSL Expression Operators
------------------------

This release extends ``cond_expression`` with three boolean operators for guard
conditions and other boolean expression sites:

- ``A => B`` and ``A implies B`` express implication. The canonical DSL spelling
  is ``=>``. Implication is right-associative, so ``A => B => C`` means
  ``A => (B => C)``.
- ``A xor B`` expresses boolean exclusive-or. Chained ``xor`` is a
  left-associative boolean parity chain, not an exactly-one-of-many operator.
- ``A iff B`` expresses boolean equivalence and is the readable spelling of
  boolean equality. Chained ``iff`` expressions use the same boolean equality
  precedence layer as ``==`` and ``!=``.

Compatibility Notes
-------------------

``implies``, ``xor``, and ``iff`` are now reserved DSL keywords. Existing
machines that used these names for variables, states, or events must rename
those identifiers before using this release.

``->`` remains the state-transition arrow and is not an implication operator in
guard conditions. Use ``=>`` or ``implies`` instead.

``^`` remains the numeric bitwise XOR operator. It can be used inside arithmetic
expressions that are compared in a guard, for example:

.. code-block:: fcstm

   StateA -> StateB : if [(flags ^ 0xFF) == 0];

It is not a boolean XOR spelling:

.. code-block:: fcstm

   StateA -> StateB : if [a > 0 xor b > 0];   // valid
   StateA -> StateB : if [(a > 0) ^ (b > 0)]; // invalid
   StateA -> StateB : if [true ^ false];      // invalid
